        What the heck is Sonoa !? 
        <div className='about-container'>
            Sonoa is a tree with deep roots, 
            planted at the intersection of alternative 
            rock and introspective chill-core. 
            Through meditative lyrics and melodic riffage, 
            may the Sonoa tree extend its branches to you, 
            and nurture all those who feel lost and misunderstood.
